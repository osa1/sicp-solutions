This repository contains my solutions and explanations(in Turkish) to exercises in the legendary computer science textbook, [structure and interpretation of computer programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).


TODO:

- I've already done the first chapter, but didn't take note. Maybe I solve all exercises in first chapter and make a commit.
- Exercise 2.14, 2.15, 2.16.
- Exercise 3.47. (I'm reading chapter 3.5 right now)
- Fourth chapter.
- Fifth chapter.
