This repository contains my solutions and explanations(in Turkish) to exercises in the legendary computer science textbook, [structure and interpretation of computer programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).


TODO:

- I've already done the first chapter, but didn't take note. Maybe I solve all exercises in first chapter and make a commit.
- Second chapter is on the way. I have all the answers but it will take some time to organize them.
- Third chapter, I'm reading it right now.
- Fourth chapter.
- Fifth chapter, lol.
